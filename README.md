# Audit Data Analysis

## Background

This Repo contains two scripts which were used to analyse prescription data in a GP practice and compare it to prescription data in Fife and Scotland. 

## Methods

The scripts were created in a web-based Jupiter Notebook with Pandas 1.5.3 and Python 3.11.3.
CSV files were retrieved from Public Health Scotland.
